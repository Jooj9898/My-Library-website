# 📚 My Library Website

A fully functional website that allows users to search, reserve, and manage books from a comprehensive database.
This project displays my proficiency in HTML, PHP and CSS. My SQL and datbase management skills are heavily implemented in this project.
It displays my ability to handle sessions in PHP and POST forms as well as stylizing with CSS to make an overall
pleasant experience both functionally and aesthetically for the user. 

## Features
Users can:
- 🔍 **Search** for books by title or author (including partial search).
- 📖 **Reserve** a book of their choice.
- 🗂️ **View** all their reservations in one place.
- ❌ **Unreserve** books at will.
- 🚪 **Logout** easily after their session.

## User Authentication
- Users can **log in** to their account or **register** as a new user.
- Registration automatically adds the user to the database.
